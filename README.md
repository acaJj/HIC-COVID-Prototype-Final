# HIC-COVID-Prototype-Final
Final figma prototype for Assignment 3

## Overview

This project was created as an assignment for Ghassem Tofighi's HCI class at Sheridan College. It is meant to be a prototype for a mobile app that focuses on assisting people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The app allows you to create a profile and interact with other members of your local community (determined by specifying your location). The pandemic has made it hard for many people and since we are no longer able to safely interact face-to-face, it possesses features that simulate the social process. Users are able to connect with others through text chats as well as video/audio calls in order to meet new people.

The app is also designed with a Community Assistance Portal, where people in need such as the elderly are able to send requests for help with things like buying groceries or picking up medicine. This allows the most at-risk members of society to safely obtain the essentials that they need for their everyday lives without putting themselves at a greater risk. Users are able to volunteer to assist the members who send out requests.

## Top 5 Unique Features Planned for the Prototype

1. Community Assistance - Users will be able to get in contact with members of their community and get help with groceries, socializing, etc,
2. Video Calls - The app will help users keep social contact with others by allowing them to video call each other for support.
3. Text Chats - Users can text each other using the app in order to create a social bond between them during quarantine.
4. Audio Calls - If users want to talk to each other using voice, but don't want to show their face, audio phone calls are also an option
5. Test Site Locator - Based on the users' location settings in their profile, the app can find the closest COVID testing centre to them and give directions.
